## Rainfall-Runoff-Model

After calculating the depth and amount of runoff, the model will determine whether or not the runoff volume surpasses the flood threshold.

Assumptions: 

Within the watershed, this model assumes uniform land use and soil conditions.
It can be expanded to include more precise flood routing, infiltration, groundwater flow, and rainfall that varies over time.
For forecasts to be dependable, CN values must be calibrated precisely.
This rainfall-runoff model can be extended for more intricate watershed management situations and is a useful tool for predicting flood events.
